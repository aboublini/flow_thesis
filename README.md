# üéì Thesis - About the survey
<p align="justify">
  My thesis is a research project that explores the impact of gender on users‚Äô UI/UX design preferences. The topic is approached through
  a comparative study, which led to the conclusion that gender, as a demographic characteristic, does indeed have an influence on the user‚Äôs 
  overall perception and preferences, regarding the design of a digital product. The study was conducted through a questionnaire survey and the
  respondents who participated in it, consisted of 122 women and 106 men in Greece. <br/>
  At first, participants had to interact with three versions (male, female, and neutral) of a productivity app that I developed in React JS 
  and then answer the questionnaires, expressing their personal opinion on the design aspect of each version. Then, the data were analyzed in a 
  Jupyter notebook using Python and utilizing various data analytic libraries and statistical analysis methods, such as Welch‚Äôs t-test
  and Pearson‚Äôs chi-square test.
